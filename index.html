            <p id="statement"> I'm a Texas native that went to the University of Wisconsin and spent one too many winters up in the Midwest. I've coached girls lacrosse on and off for 10 years, to a range of ages, from 1st grade to High school Varsity. I'm educated in environmental
                science, philosophy, and business, and I work and consult for natural resource companies in the energy and stonework businesses. I love all animals and team sports. I have an aversion to dairy and the industrial farming practices that
                go along with it and the meat industry. I love to read, ski, and try out new coffee spots or restaurants, so it's safe to say I'm loving living in Denver!
